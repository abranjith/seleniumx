    """ This class represents a particular action such as key down, move pointer etc. Unfortunately these operations are not
    atomic and this is an attempt to solve some of that.
    For eg - before moving to an element (action), get its co-ordinates from browser (pre-action) and use the return value as params
    to the action.
    This class also solves for more complex cases such as chaining of multiple pre-actions. With that, user can specify all the
    pre-actions (sync or async) that needs to happen in order where return value from previous action can be passed over to next and so on.
    Since python provides many ways of specifying arguments for a function, it is difficult to cater for all those cases. This class only
    solves for cases where return values from previous call matches next call (position wise). User needs to keep this in mind before desiging the
    functions. Any specific pre-action can be thought of as pre-action(args + previous_return_args). And results from final pre-action can be passed
    over to the action_fn
    WARNING - user is responsible for overall orchestration (that is perform pre actions before invoking final action  object). 
              If not results will not be accurate.
